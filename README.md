# Gender Classification Using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning project aimed at classifying gender based on images. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and it is trained and evaluated on a dataset of male and female faces.


## Introduction
Gender classification is a significant task in computer vision with applications in various fields such as user profiling, human-computer interaction, security systems, and targeted advertising. This project aims to build a gender classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
